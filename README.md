Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project was an assignment where we worked as a consultant for a company that designs systems and were hired by the team at DrivePass to develop a website/app that can allow drivers looking to get licensed the tools necessary to pass their first driving tests. The system consisted of a serverless architecture where the consumer could be offered various packages. These packages offered driving lessons with a driving instructor and training vehicle. The consumer could also edit these reservations, create profile updates and creations, and track progress. The system also allows for administrative tasks such as account creation, deletion, administrative rights revocation, and updating offerings for the various courses. The system is also capable of being updated with streamlined data from the DMV to provide the most up-to-date requirements and example tests for the consumers. 

What did you do particularly well?

I feel like I captured the flow of the system well with my various UML designs. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would like to improve, per the feedback of my professor, to use less jargon and create a more non-technical stakeholder wording that doesn't prevent the audience from being caught up with unnecessarily technical words. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The user's needs are implemented by thinking of edge cases, taking direct feedback from the interactions via interviews as well as showcasing the design early on to improve upon anything else the customer might consider critical. It's important to consider because needs evolve as the design lifecycle continues. From the beginning to the end, priorities shift. 


How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?# CS255

The approach that I took on this project is to think critically about the different processees and not be bogged down by the technical requirements. This allowed me to provide a working basis of how the product should accomplish the needed functions and how we can improve upon them. In the future, I would employ focusing on the completeness of the system as well as knowing that needs change over time so it is ok to pivot and discard earlier work as long as check-ins with the other stakeholders are held at regular cadence.
